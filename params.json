The goal is to teach students how to avoid simple coding mistakes by providing concise code examples.  Key characteristics are: \r\n* 10 minutes long or less\r\n* Can be understood by a third-year college student in a software engineering course\r\n* Socially-relevant examples\r\n* Can be run on a Linux console, using make\r\n* Simple, concise, but also not contrived. \r\n* Real-world CVEs (with source code patches linked) are a big plus\r\n\r\nCode Formatting Guidelines\r\n======================\r\n\r\n* All source code must be \"projector-friendly\", meaning that the vast majority of the demo code should be readable at:\r\n    * 90 characters wide\r\n    * 48 lines long\r\n* Having the _entire_ program be under 48 lines is not hard rule (e.g. import statements are not super important), but the instructor should be able to show the main body, including comments, on a 4:3 projector screen with 18 point Lucida Console font in Vim with line numbers set. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
