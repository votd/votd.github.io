   <p>Vulnerability of the Day is a pedagogically-curated collection of vulnerability demonstrations for undergraduate software engineering students.</p>
	   
	<p>That's a lot of fancy talk for a bunch of neat code demos. Our future programmers in particular need to know about the most relevant, code-level vulnerabilities in the wild today. In my experience, undergrads...</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>...need executable examples to play with. </li>
		<li>...need extraneous details stripped away so that the problem simple presents itself.</li>
		<li>...need convincing that these vulnerabilities are real </li> 
		<li>...need a daily balance of concrete, code-level material to complement abstract, cross-cutting security principles.</li>
	</ul> 
	
	<p>Thus, VotD is a set of brief coding demonstrations that the instructor can use at the beginning of every day of the class. We strive to make each VotD have the following attributes:</p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>10 minutes long or less</li>
    <li>Targeted to third-year college students in a software engineering course</li>
    <li>Socially-relevant domains</li>
    <li>Can be run on a Linux console, using <code>make</code></li>
    <li>Concise without being contrived </li>
    <li>Real-world historical exmaples with source code patches linked</li>
    <li>Exhibiting a wide variety of key security principles</li>
	<li>Projector-friendly settings and formatting</li>
   </ul>
